### Navigating to IAM & Admin

1. **Log in** to your GCP account.
2. Access the **IAM & Admin** dashboard from the main navigation menu to begin the process of assigning roles and permissions.

- For **application-related operations**, choose the project titled **co-op-world-server**.

### Server-side Operations Permissions

#### Compute Admin
